                    <p>The PEBC Qualifying Examination Part 1 consists of 200 multiple-choice questions to be completed in 3.5 hours, divided into two sessions of 100 questions each (1.75 hours per session). Effective time management is crucial for success, as running out of time can prevent you from answering questions you know. This guide provides proven strategies to help you manage your time effectively throughout the exam.</p>

                    <p>With 200 questions in 3.5 hours, you have approximately 1.05 minutes per question. However, this doesn't mean every question should take exactly 1 minute—some will be faster, others slower. Understanding how to allocate your time strategically is key.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Time Breakdown</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Total time:</strong> 3.5 hours (210 minutes)</li>
                        <li><strong>Two sessions:</strong> 1.75 hours (105 minutes) each</li>
                        <li><strong>Questions per session:</strong> 100 questions</li>
                        <li><strong>Average time per question:</strong> 1.05 minutes (63 seconds)</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h3>Realistic Time Distribution</h3>
                    <p>In practice, time distribution should be:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Easy questions:</strong> 30-45 seconds each</li>
                        <li><strong>Moderate questions:</strong> 60-90 seconds each</li>
                        <li><strong>Difficult questions:</strong> 90-120 seconds each (or mark and return)</li>
                        <li><strong>Review time:</strong> 10-15 minutes per session</li>

                        <p><strong>Key Insight:</strong> The goal isn't to spend exactly 1 minute on every question, but to maintain an overall pace that allows you to answer all questions and have time for review.</p>

                    <h2><i class="fas fa-tachometer-alt"></i> Pacing Strategies</h2>
                    
                    <p>Effective pacing involves maintaining a steady rhythm throughout the exam while allowing flexibility for difficult questions. Here are proven pacing strategies used by successful candidates.</p>
                    
                    <h3>1. The 25-Question Checkpoint Method</h3>
                    <p>Check your progress after every 25 questions:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Target time:</strong> 25-30 minutes for 25 questions</li>
                        <li><strong>If ahead:</strong> You can slow down slightly or spend more time on difficult questions</li>
                        <li><strong>If behind:</strong> Increase your pace or skip difficult questions temporarily</li>
                        <li><strong>Benefit:</strong> Early detection of pacing issues allows for course correction</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h3>2. The Two-Pass Strategy</h3>
                    <p>Answer questions in two passes:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>First pass:</strong> Answer all questions you're confident about (aim for 60-70 questions in 60-70 minutes)</li>
                        <li><strong>Second pass:</strong> Return to marked/difficult questions with remaining time</li>
                        <li><strong>Advantage:</strong> Ensures you answer all questions you know before running out of time</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h3>3. The Steady Pace Method</h3>
                    <p>Maintain consistent pace throughout:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Approach:</strong> Answer questions sequentially, spending 1 minute average per question</li>
                        <li><strong>Mark difficult questions:</strong> Don't spend more than 2 minutes on any single question initially</li>
                        <li><strong>Return later:</strong> Use review time to address marked questions</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h3>4. Reading Efficiency Techniques</h3>
                    <p>Speed up your reading without sacrificing comprehension:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Read the question first:</strong> Start with the last line to know what you're looking for</li>
                        <li><strong>Scan patient information:</strong> Quickly identify key factors (age, allergies, comorbidities)</li>
                        <li><strong>Focus on relevant details:</strong> Don't get bogged down in extraneous information</li>
                        <li><strong>Practice active reading:</strong> Underline or mentally note key information as you read</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                
                <div class="content-block" id="question-prioritization">
                    <h2><i class="fas fa-sort-amount-down"></i> Question Prioritization Techniques</h2>
                    
                    <p>Not all questions are created equal. Learning to quickly identify and prioritize questions can help you maximize your score within the time limit.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Quick Identification System</h3>
                    <p>Learn to quickly categorize questions:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Type A (Quick):</strong> Direct knowledge questions, simple calculations, basic recall (30-45 seconds)</li>
                        <li><strong>Type B (Moderate):</strong> Clinical scenarios requiring some analysis (60-90 seconds)</li>
                        <li><strong>Type C (Complex):</strong> Multi-step problems, complex scenarios, unfamiliar topics (mark and return)</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h3>When to Skip and Return</h3>
                    <p>Skip a question if:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>You've spent 2+ minutes without progress</li>
                        <li>The topic is completely unfamiliar</li>
                        <li>You're stuck between two options and can't decide</li>
                        <li>The question requires extensive calculation or reasoning</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Important:</strong> Always mark skipped questions so you can return to them during review time.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Process of Elimination for Speed</h3>
                    <p>Use elimination to answer faster:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Quickly eliminate obviously wrong answers</li>
                        <li>If you can eliminate 2 of 4 options, make an educated guess and move on</li>
                        <li>Don't spend time trying to confirm the exact answer if you're confident in your elimination</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                
                <div class="content-block" id="session-management">
                    <h2><i class="fas fa-calendar-day"></i> Managing Each Session</h2>
                    
                    <p>The exam is divided into two 1.75-hour sessions. Managing each session effectively requires different strategies than managing the entire exam.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Session 1 Strategy</h3>
                    <p>For the first 100-question session:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Start strong:</strong> Answer the first 25 questions carefully to build confidence</li>
                        <li><strong>Establish rhythm:</strong> Find your pace in the first 30 minutes</li>
                        <li><strong>Monitor progress:</strong> Check time at questions 25, 50, and 75</li>
                        <li><strong>Reserve time:</strong> Aim to finish answering by 90 minutes, leaving 15 minutes for review</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h3>Break Between Sessions</h3>
                    <p>Use the break effectively:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Take a short walk to refresh your mind</li>
                        <li>Have a light snack if needed</li>
                        <li>Use the restroom</li>
                        <li>Don't discuss questions with other candidates</li>
                        <li>Return to the exam room a few minutes early to refocus</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h3>Session 2 Strategy</h3>
                    <p>For the second 100-question session:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Maintain momentum:</strong> Don't slow down due to fatigue</li>
                        <li><strong>Stay focused:</strong> Treat it as a fresh start</li>
                        <li><strong>Same pacing:</strong> Use the same time management approach as Session 1</li>
                        <li><strong>Final review:</strong> Use remaining time to review marked questions and verify answers</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                    <h2><i class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i> Common Time Management Pitfalls</h2>
                    
                    <h3>1. Perfectionism</h3>
                    <p>Avoid spending excessive time trying to be 100% certain of every answer:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Problem:</strong> Spending 3-5 minutes on difficult questions</li>
                        <li><strong>Solution:</strong> Make your best guess, mark it, and move on. Return during review if time permits</li>
                        <li><strong>Reality:</strong> You don't need 100% to pass—aim for consistent progress</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h3>2. Getting Stuck on Early Questions</h3>
                    <p>Don't let difficult early questions derail your entire session:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Problem:</strong> Spending too much time on questions 1-20, leaving insufficient time for later questions</li>
                        <li><strong>Solution:</strong> If stuck early, mark and move on. You can return after establishing momentum</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h3>3. Rushing Through Easy Questions</h3>
                    <p>Don't sacrifice accuracy for speed on questions you know:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Problem:</strong> Making careless errors on easy questions by rushing</li>
                        <li><strong>Solution:</strong> Take 30-45 seconds to read carefully, even on easy questions</li>
                        <li><strong>Balance:</strong> Be efficient but thorough</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h3>4. Not Using Review Time</h3>
                    <p>Many candidates finish with time left but don't use it effectively:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Problem:</strong> Submitting early without reviewing</li>
                        <li><strong>Solution:</strong> Always use full time. Review marked questions, check calculations, verify answers</li>
                    </ul>
