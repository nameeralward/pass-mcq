                    <h3>1. Simulate Exam Conditions</h3>
                    <p>One of the most effective ways to prepare for the PEBC MCQ is to practice under conditions that mimic the actual exam:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Take full-length practice tests (200 questions)</li>
                        <li>Time yourself strictly (3.5 hours total, divided into two 1.75-hour sessions)</li>
                        <li>Use a computer for practice tests when possible</li>
                        <li>Take breaks only as allowed in the real exam</li>
                        <li>Practice with the passMCQ app's Exam Simulation mode</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>Regular simulation builds stamina and helps you identify your optimal pace. The passMCQ app offers full-length practice exams that mirror the actual PEBC MCQ format.</p>
                    
                    <h3>2. Master the Exam Blueprint</h3>
                    <p>Understanding the exam content distribution is crucial:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Review the PEBC MCQ blueprint thoroughly</li>
                        <li>Know which therapeutic areas are weighted more heavily</li>
                        <li>Focus your final review on high-yield areas</li>
                        <li>Identify your personal weak areas through practice tests</li>

                        <p><strong>PEBC Exam Tip:</strong> The MCQ exam focuses heavily on clinical therapeutics, patient assessment, and drug therapy problems. Approximately 70-80% of questions involve clinical decision-making.</p>

                    <h3>3. Read the Last Line First</h3>
                    <p>For clinical scenario questions:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Start by reading the actual question at the end of the scenario</li>
                        <li>This helps you focus on relevant information as you read the case</li>
                        <li>Identify what the question is asking (drug selection, monitoring, counseling, etc.)</li>
                        <li>Then read the scenario with that specific question in mind</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>This approach saves time and helps you filter out extraneous information in complex cases.</p>
                    
                    <h3>4. Maintain Awareness of Time</h3>
                    <p>With 200 questions in two 1.75-hour sessions:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>You have about 1.05 minutes per question on average</li>
                        <li>Check the time after every 25 questions</li>
                        <li>Aim to complete 50 questions in 50-55 minutes in each session</li>
                        <li>Leave 10-15 minutes at the end of each session for review</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>If you find yourself falling behind, slightly increase your pace and be more decisive with your answers.</p>

                    <h2><i class="fas fa-check-square"></i> Clinical Scenario Question Strategies</h2>
                    
                    <h3>5. Analyze Patient-Specific Factors</h3>
                    <p>Clinical scenarios require careful consideration of patient factors:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Note age, gender, pregnancy status, and comorbidities</li>
                        <li>Identify drug allergies and previous adverse reactions</li>
                        <li>Consider renal/hepatic function when mentioned</li>
                        <li>Look for medication adherence issues or patient preferences</li>
                        <li>Pay attention to current medications for potential interactions</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h3>6. Use the Process of Elimination</h3>
                    <p>When unsure of the correct answer:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Eliminate options with absolute contraindications first</li>
                        <li>Remove options that don't address the primary problem</li>
                        <li>Compare remaining options based on efficacy, safety, and appropriateness</li>
                        <li>When down to two options, consider Canadian guidelines as the tiebreaker</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <div class="note-section">
                        <p><strong>PEBC Exam Tip:</strong> Each question is worth 0.5% of your total score. A strategic guess after elimination is better than leaving a question unanswered.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <h3>7. Watch for Common Distractors</h3>
                    <p>Be alert for these common types of incorrect options:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Treatments that follow non-Canadian guidelines</li>
                        <li>Options that address symptoms but not the underlying condition</li>
                        <li>Therapies that are correct for the condition but inappropriate for this specific patient</li>
                        <li>Options that contain familiar terms but are used incorrectly</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                
                <div class="content-block" id="time-management">
                    <h2><i class="fas fa-clock"></i> Time Management Techniques</h2>
                    
                    <h3>8. Use a Three-Pass System</h3>
                    <p>Consider this efficient approach to each exam session:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>First Pass:</strong> Answer all questions you're confident about (45-60 seconds max per question)</li>
                        <li><strong>Second Pass:</strong> Return to flagged questions that require more thought (1-2 minutes per question)</li>
                        <li><strong>Third Pass:</strong> Review any remaining difficult questions and check your answers if time permits</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>This approach ensures you capture all the "easy points" before spending time on more challenging questions.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="content-block" id="anxiety-reduction">
                    <h2><i class="fas fa-heart"></i> Test Anxiety Reduction</h2>
                    
                    <h3>9. Use Stress Management Techniques</h3>
                    <p>If you feel anxiety building during the exam:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Practice deep breathing (4-7-8 technique: inhale for 4, hold for 7, exhale for 8)</li>
                        <li>Use positive self-talk and affirmations</li>
                        <li>Take a 30-second mental break if needed</li>
                        <li>Focus only on the current question, not on your overall performance</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h3>10. Trust Your Preparation</h3>
                    <p>On exam day:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Avoid last-minute cramming</li>
                        <li>Trust your first instinct unless you have a clear reason to change</li>
                        <li>Remember that you've prepared thoroughly with quality resources</li>
                        <li>Maintain perspective - you can retake the exam if necessary</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <div class="note-section">
                        <p><strong>Remember:</strong> The PEBC Qualifying Examination Part 1 is challenging, but with proper preparation and test-taking strategies, you can significantly improve your chances of success.</p>

                    <p>The best way to internalize these strategies is through consistent practice.

                    <p>Clinical scenario questions require a different approach than knowledge-based questions. Regular practice with realistic cases will help you develop the critical thinking skills needed for success.</p>
