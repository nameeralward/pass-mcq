                    <p>The PEBC Qualifying Examination Part 1 tests your ability to apply therapeutic knowledge to clinical scenarios. Develop these critical thinking skills:</p>
                    
                    <h3>1. Systematic Patient Assessment</h3>
                    
                    <p>When approaching clinical scenarios, use this structured framework:</p>
                    
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Identify the primary problem:</strong> What is the main therapeutic issue that needs to be addressed?</li>
                        <li><strong>Assess patient-specific factors:</strong> Age, comorbidities, renal/hepatic function, pregnancy status, allergies</li>
                        <li><strong>Review current medications:</strong> Look for drug interactions, therapeutic duplications, or inappropriate therapies</li>
                        <li><strong>Apply guidelines:</strong> What do Canadian guidelines recommend for this specific situation?</li>
                        <li><strong>Consider alternatives:</strong> What are the pros and cons of each potential intervention?</li>
                    </ol>
                    
                    <h3>2. Therapeutic Decision-Making</h3>
                    
                    <p>When selecting optimal drug therapy, consider these factors:</p>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Efficacy:</strong> Is there evidence supporting the use of this medication for this indication?</li>
                        <li><strong>Safety:</strong> What are the potential adverse effects? Are they significant for this specific patient?</li>
                        <li><strong>Patient factors:</strong> How do age, renal/hepatic function, comorbidities, and other patient-specific factors influence this decision?</li>
                        <li><strong>Drug interactions:</strong> Are there potential interactions with current medications?</li>
                        <li><strong>Practicality:</strong> Consider cost, dosing frequency, and other factors that may affect adherence</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h3>3. Monitoring and Follow-up</h3>
                    
                    <p>The PEBC exam often tests knowledge of appropriate monitoring parameters:</p>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li>Know the specific parameters to monitor for each drug class</li>
                        <li>Understand the timing of monitoring (baseline, early therapy, maintenance)</li>
                        <li>Recognize signs/symptoms that suggest adverse effects or treatment failure</li>
                        <li>Know when to adjust therapy based on monitoring results</li>
