                    <h3>1. Patient Confidentiality</h3>
                    <p><strong>Scenario:</strong> A family member asks about a patient's medications.</p>
                    <p><strong>Key principles:</strong> Patient confidentiality is paramount. Information can only be disclosed with patient consent or in specific circumstances (e.g., imminent harm, legal requirements).</p>
                    
                    <h3>2. Medication Errors</h3>
                    <p><strong>Scenario:</strong> A pharmacist discovers they dispensed the wrong medication.</p>
                    <p><strong>Key principles:</strong> Immediate patient safety is the priority. The error must be disclosed to the patient and prescriber, and reported according to provincial requirements.</p>
                    
                    <h3>3. Refusal to Fill Prescriptions</h3>

                    <p><strong>Key principles:</strong> Pharmacists have a professional obligation to verify prescription appropriateness. If concerns cannot be resolved, the prescription should not be filled, and the prescriber should be contacted.</p>
                    
                    <h3>4. Emergency Supplies</h3>
                    <p><strong>Scenario:</strong> A patient requests an emergency supply of medication.</p>

                    <h3>5. Conscientious Objection</h3>
                    <p><strong>Scenario:</strong> A pharmacist objects to providing a particular service on moral or religious grounds.</p>
                    <p><strong>Key principles:</strong> While pharmacists may have conscientious objections, they must ensure patient access to care. This typically requires referring the patient to another pharmacist or pharmacy.</p>
