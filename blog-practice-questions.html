                    <h2><i class="fas fa-question-circle"></i> Why Practice Questions Are Essential</h2>
                    
                    <p>Practice questions serve multiple purposes beyond simply testing your knowledge. Understanding these benefits helps you use questions more effectively.</p>
                    
                    <h3>1. Active Recall and Retrieval Practice</h3>
                    <p>Answering questions forces your brain to actively retrieve information, which strengthens memory more effectively than passive reading:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Active learning:</strong> You must think through problems rather than just recognizing information</li>
                        <li><strong>Memory strengthening:</strong> Each time you recall information, you strengthen the neural pathways</li>
                        <li><strong>Application practice:</strong> Questions require you to apply knowledge to new scenarios</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h3>2. Identifying Knowledge Gaps</h3>
                    <p>Practice questions reveal what you don't know:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Highlight weak therapeutic areas</li>
                        <li>Identify calculation weaknesses</li>
                        <li>Reveal gaps in understanding Canadian guidelines</li>
                        <li>Show areas where you confuse similar concepts</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h3>3. Familiarity with Exam Format</h3>
                    <p>Regular practice with MCQs helps you:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Become comfortable with question structure and wording</li>

                    <h3>For Correct Answers</h3>
                    <p>Don't just move on—analyze why you got it right:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Confirm your reasoning:</strong> Was your thought process correct, or did you guess correctly?</li>
                        <li><strong>Identify key concepts:</strong> What therapeutic principles or guidelines applied?</li>
                        <li><strong>Note the approach:</strong> How did you identify the correct answer? Can you replicate this approach?</li>
                        <li><strong>Consider alternatives:</strong> Why were other options wrong? Understanding this prevents future errors</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h3>For Incorrect Answers</h3>

                        <li><strong>Create a study note:</strong> Write down the key learning point for future review</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h3>Using Detailed Explanations</h3>
                    <p>The passMCQ app provides comprehensive explanations for each question:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Read the full explanation:</strong> Don't just check if you were right or wrong</li>
                        <li><strong>Understand the reasoning:</strong> Learn the clinical thought process</li>
                        <li><strong>Note key references:</strong> Identify which guidelines or resources support the answer</li>
                        <li><strong>Review related concepts:</strong> Use explanations to identify related topics to study</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <div class="note-section">
                        <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Keep a "mistakes journal" where you document incorrect answers, the correct reasoning, and what you learned. Review this journal regularly to prevent repeating the same errors.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                
                <div class="content-block" id="spaced-repetition">
                    <h2><i class="fas fa-redo"></i> Using Spaced Repetition</h2>
                    
                    <p>Spaced repetition is one of the most effective learning techniques. Learn how to incorporate it into your practice question routine.</p>
                    
                    <h3>What is Spaced Repetition?</h3>
                    <p>Spaced repetition involves reviewing material at increasing intervals to optimize long-term retention:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>First review:</strong> Review incorrect answers within 24 hours</li>
                        <li><strong>Second review:</strong> Review again after 3-7 days</li>
                        <li><strong>Third review:</strong> Review after 2-3 weeks</li>
                        <li><strong>Final review:</strong> Review before the exam</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h3>Implementing Spaced Repetition with Practice Questions</h3>
                    <p>Use the passMCQ app's features to implement spaced repetition:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Bookmark difficult questions:</strong> Mark questions you found challenging</li>
                        <li><strong>Review incorrect answers:</strong> The app tracks your incorrect answers for easy review</li>
                        <li><strong>Create custom sets:</strong> Build question sets from previously incorrect answers</li>
                        <li><strong>Schedule reviews:</strong> Set reminders to review bookmarked questions weekly</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h3>The Forgetting Curve</h3>
                    <p>Understanding the forgetting curve helps you time your reviews:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>You forget approximately 50% of new information within 24 hours</li>
                        <li>Without review, retention continues to decline</li>
                        <li>Each review strengthens memory and slows forgetting</li>
                        <li>Spaced repetition optimizes review timing for maximum retention</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2><i class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i> Common Mistakes When Using Practice Questions</h2>
                    
                    <p>Avoid these common pitfalls that can reduce the effectiveness of your practice question sessions.</p>
                    
                    <h3>1. Guessing Without Learning</h3>
                    <p><strong>Mistake:</strong> Answering questions quickly without thinking, then moving on without reviewing</p>
                    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Always think through each question, even if you're unsure. Then review the explanation regardless of whether you got it right or wrong.</p>
                    
                    <h3>2. Only Doing Easy Questions</h3>
                    <p><strong>Mistake:</strong> Avoiding difficult questions or only practicing topics you know well</p>
                    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Deliberately practice your weak areas. Use the passMCQ app to filter questions by difficulty or topic to target your weaknesses.</p>
                    
                    <h3>3. Memorizing Answers Instead of Understanding</h3>
                    <p><strong>Mistake:</strong> Remembering the answer to specific questions rather than understanding the underlying concepts</p>
                    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Focus on understanding why the answer is correct. When you see similar questions, apply the same principles rather than recalling the exact answer.</p>
                    
                    <h3>4. Not Reviewing Incorrect Answers</h3>
                    <p><strong>Mistake:</strong> Simply noting that you got a question wrong without understanding why</p>
                    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> For every incorrect answer, read the explanation, understand the reasoning, and study the related topic. This is where the most learning occurs.</p>
                    
                    <h3>5. Avoiding Timed Practice</h3>
                    <p><strong>Mistake:</strong> Only practicing in untimed mode, then struggling with time management on the actual exam</p>
                    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Regularly practice under timed conditions. Use the passMCQ app's timed quiz mode and full-length exam simulations.</p>
                    
                    <h3>6. Not Using Full-Length Practice Exams</h3>
                    <p><strong>Mistake:</strong> Only doing short practice sets, never simulating the full exam experience</p>
                    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Take at least 3-5 full-length practice exams (200 questions, 3.5 hours) before your actual exam date.</p>
