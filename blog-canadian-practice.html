                    <p>Canadian cardiovascular guidelines have several important differences from those used in other countries, particularly regarding hypertension management and lipid therapy.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Hypertension Canada Guidelines:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Blood Pressure Targets:</strong> Generally aim for &lt;140/90 mmHg for most patients, and &lt;130/80 mmHg for those with diabetes or high cardiovascular risk</li>
                        <li><strong>First-line Agents:</strong> Thiazide diuretics, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or long-acting CCBs are all considered appropriate first-line options</li>
                        <li><strong>Combination Therapy:</strong> Initial combination therapy is recommended for patients with BP ≥20/10 mmHg above target</li>
                        <li><strong>Home BP Monitoring:</strong> Emphasized as an important component of hypertension management</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h3>Canadian Cardiovascular Society Lipid Guidelines:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Risk Assessment:</strong> Uses the Framingham Risk Score modified for family history</li>
                        <li><strong>Primary Prevention:</strong> Statin therapy recommended for high-risk individuals (≥20% 10-year risk) or those with LDL-C ≥3.5 mmol/L</li>
                        <li><strong>Secondary Prevention:</strong> High-intensity statin therapy for all patients with established cardiovascular disease</li>
