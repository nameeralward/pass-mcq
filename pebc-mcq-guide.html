                <h3><i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i> Effective Preparation Strategies</h3>
                
                <h4>1. Understand the Exam Blueprint</h4>
                <p>Familiarize yourself with the PEBC's competency profile and exam blueprint to understand what knowledge areas and competencies are emphasized.</p>
                
                <h4>2. Create a Structured Study Plan</h4>
                <p>Develop a comprehensive study schedule that covers all therapeutic areas, with more time allocated to high-yield topics and your personal areas of weakness.</p>
                
                <h4>3. Focus on Clinical Application</h4>
                <p>The MCQ exam emphasizes clinical reasoning rather than rote memorization. Practice applying your knowledge to patient cases and clinical scenarios.</p>
                
                <h4>4. Use Quality Study Resources</h4>
                <p>Utilize reputable study materials specifically designed for the PEBC Qualifying Examination, including therapeutic guidelines, clinical handbooks, and practice exams.</p>
                
                <h4>5. Practice with Sample Questions</h4>
                <p>Regular practice with exam-style questions helps familiarize you with the question format and improves your test-taking skills and time management.</p>
                
                <h4>6. Review Canadian Guidelines</h4>
                <p>Pay special attention to Canadian clinical practice guidelines, as these may differ from guidelines in other countries.</p>
